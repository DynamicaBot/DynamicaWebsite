# Errors

In the process of using the bot you might come across a few different errors.

## "Must be in a Dynamica-controlled voice channel."

This one's pretty self explanatory. In order to change the settings of a Dynamica channel you must be in a valid [`secondary` channel](/docs/commands/intro#technical-terms).

## "Must have the Dynamica role to ..."

If you get this message make sure that you have the `Dynamica Manager` role. Without it you're not allowed to run the majority of Dynamica commands.

## "Bot requires manage channel permissions."

You'll only get this when you create a new [`primary` channel](/docs/commands/intro#technical-terms) and it means that you need to give the bot "Manage Channel" permissions. Without this the bot will not function.
