# FAQ

This is the FAQ for Dynamica, any questions that get asked and I'm able to answer go here.

## Why does this random bot need admin?

I know it is unusual for a bot to need admin permissions but the main reason for this is so that it's possible for it to manage private channels. Without these permissions it would end up locking itself out or experiencing another issue.

## What does this bot do?

It may not be obvious at first but Dynamica is similar to bots like AVC or VoiceMaster with the main exception being that the entirety of it's code is open source and free to browse.
